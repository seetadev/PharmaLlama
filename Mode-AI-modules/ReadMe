We are enabling pharma fleet managers and developers with an AI tool on Mode and also a developer tool with a spreadsheet interface for analytics and visualization. AI Tool: We are using Yolo library and EtherCalc OSS on Mode to develop an Artificial Intelligence-based object detection system that utilizes Mode, IPFS/Filecoin blockchain solutions using fluence p2p infrastructure for sorting information obtained from a variety of cameras. With just a cell phone, users are offered a serverless solution that can detect objects in real time and more object types for better accuracy. Our technical solution on Mode enables fleet driver monitoring, incident management and collision avoidance: Incident-based reporting & Collision detection (even when a vehicle is parked) and video footage associated with it. Video footage for abnormal driver behavior (complete view of the car with 2 cameras â€“ front and back and open source video streaming).

We are developing tools to enable no code, low code analytics tooling using an open source analytics and visualization tool, namely Mode XLS, which enables tabulation, organization, collaboration, visualization, graphing and charting.
