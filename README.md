# How it works?

Camera Management: Add/edit/delete cameras with a front end application with Optimism Public Goods tools, Livepeer and Mode modules, Ethereum, IPFS for snapshots of road incident, Worldcoin wallet for toll ticketing, data retrieval.

Object Detection using open source AWS solutions, air quality measurements with ASDI OpenAQ and Pytorch/Tensorflow deep learning library using CNN neural networks.

Video analytics configuration using IPFS, OP public goods modules and services, ZKP and scrypt aided solution on Mode, Zora and Base for security and for data retrieval.

Live streaming with Object Detection Video Analytics using open source AWS for streaming, Safe and Layer 0 services, ZKP and scrypt aided solution for security and for snapshots.

Alarm storage using IPFS with ZKP and scrypt aided solution. Save/delete alarm metadata and image to/from IPFS. Store the hash returned from IPFS to ZKP and scrypt aided solution network, ZKP and scrypt aided solution protocol based solutions for security and for data retrieval. Provide links to alarms and blockchain transaction details.

Alarm Viewer: Add alarms with a single touch. Open the Alarm Settings menu from the home page. Add an alarm, set the wallpaper or choose an alarm tone. You can also delete an existing alarm. We are using Worldcoin wallet for NFT marketplace of alarm clock wallpapers and background ringtones purchase and auction. We are also extending and adapting Turtle Music using NFT Experiments for music curators for alarm clock. We are using DAO tooling for coordination with a social focus around community collaboration for road incidents and alarms.


# Blockchain Eco-system

1. Covalent: We are using Covalent to see all NFTs for NFC tags of Pharma Fleets across different networks. Further, we have the following Covalent end-points APIs:
Get Log Events by Contract Address: to get log events like sold/listed nft for NFC tags/NFC Tags of Fleets on marketplace. 
Get Log Events by Incident Types: to get log data for specific incident event along with its metadata
Get NFT External Metadata: To get metadata for NFT like attribute and snapshot images.
Get Historical Token Prices: To get price of token for currency that accept NFT/item on marketplace.

2. Optimism: Optimism Public Goods NFT storefront and marketplace for NFTs representing NFC tags of medical public goods and pharma assets provided by government agencies (example GeM portal). This enables on-demand availability of spare parts and prevents counterfeiting of expensive, repairable spare parts at functional locations. Further, it enables optimal inventory management and allocation at all repair sites.

Optimism Public Goods Module: This is especially useful for fleet management vehicles managed by the government for public goods delivery (Example: GeM portal goods in India) where co-incentives can be provided to contract organizations for good performance in pollution checks, green fuel adoption (switching away from diesel fuel to CNG). The workflow is as follows:

Fleet role creation procedure; Fleet vehicles identification with NFC tags; Create credits of ratings earned via pollution checks, green fuel assets; Issue green credits for fleet vehicles via pollution checks by Transport department like Pollution check control; List green credits per fleet vehicle; Handle multiple vehicles.

3. Zora: We are utilizing ZoraModuleManager, and ZoraProtocolFeeSettings in our our dapp and deploying it on Polygon, OP after registering the Zora market module. We are developing a crowdsourcing marketplace using Zora's auction house template for enabling sharing of government assets like toll prepaid card, car details information for interstate travel, driving license management and quarterly pollution check and control. We are using the zora starter kit to access ZORA API, Creator Toolkit, and Marketplace Hyperstructure. Zora's Auction House template is being utilized for NFT marketplace of alarm clock wallpapers and background ringtones purchase and auction. We are also extending and adapting Turtle Music using NFT Experiments for music curators for alarm clock. We are using DAOtooling for coordination with a social focus around community collaboration for road incidents and alarms.

4. Mode: We are enabling pharma fleet managers and developers with an AI tool on Mode and also a developer tool with a spreadsheet interface for analytics and visualization.
AI Tool: We are using Yolo library and EtherCalc OSS on Mode to develop an Artificial Intelligence-based object detection system that utilizes Mode, IPFS/Filecoin blockchain solutions using fluence p2p infrastructure for sorting information obtained from a variety of cameras. With just a cell phone, users are offered a serverless solution that can detect objects in real time and more object types for better accuracy. Our technical solution on Mode enables fleet driver monitoring, incident management and collision avoidance: Incident-based reporting & Collision detection (even when a vehicle is parked) and video footage associated with it. Video footage for abnormal driver behavior (complete view of the car with 2 cameras â€“ front and back and open source video streaming). Please visit screencasts at https://drive.google.com/drive/u/4/folders/1FAY_As4g-YzuKyAqH-IiebWLtTIUrkTz and https://drive.google.com/drive/u/4/folders/1zparCtuoGOi-fb8LDxJ_-lmxiQvMNoB3 (demo_screen capture.mov)
