We are developing a crowdsourcing marketplace using Zora's auction house template and also an app of Spinamp's web3-music-subgraph that aggregates various web3 data for enabling sharing of government assets like toll prepaid card, car details information for interstate travel, driving license management and quarterly pollution check and control. We are using the zora starter kit to access ZORA API, Creator Toolkit, and Marketplace Hyperstructure. The Zora integration (which includes catalog) is sliced out from https://github.com/ourzora/zora-v1-subgraph and also just tracks plain ERC721 transfers with mints triggered based on the first transfer.

Zora's Auction House template is being utilized for NFT marketplace of alarm clock wallpapers and background ringtones purchase and auction. We are also extending and adapting Turtle Music using NFT Experiments for music curators for alarm clock. We are using DAOtooling for coordination with a social focus around community collaboration for road incidents and alarms.

Zora's NFT components allow you to easily create your own gallery or auction house with zNFT infrastructure.

This library provides the front-end display components on top of the [`@zoralabs/nft-hooks`](https://github.com/ourzora/nft-hooks) data-fetching library;

This library works alongside the Zora [auction house](https://zora.mirror.xyz/9mQ9AeJK84USTnQ9eBY4Sc7s1bi0N8RoZd3Oy4q82FM) ([code](https://github.com/ourzora/auction-house)) allows for DAOs and individuals to run their own decentralized auction house. Arbitrary NFTs across a wide variety of contract implementations are supported.

## NFT Components

These components allow for drop-in rendering of NFTs. They work on the frontend and do not need any server-side components. These components are aware of both ongoing auctions and the perpetual markets for zNFTs, integrating latest bid information and other relevant marketplace information. They also handle most all of the same media types that the Zora marketplace natively handles (audio, video, image, HTML, and text). The components can be modified as needed and should be used as a prototype look and feel. Under the hood, they use the @zoralabs/nft-hooks library to retrieve data, if more customization is needed for the look and feel of the components the underlying data can be retrieved directly.

### Main components:

- [NFTPreview](https://ourzora.github.io/nft-components?path=/docs/renderer-nftpreview--image)
  - Used to render a zNFT preview thumbnail
- [NFTFullPage](https://ourzora.github.io/nft-components?path=/docs/renderer-nftfull--image)
  - Used to render a zNFT full page component
- [NFTDataProvider](https://ourzora.github.io/nft-components?path=/story/renderer-nftdataprovider--page)
  - Used to compose a custom set of zNFT components
- [MediaConfiguration](https://ourzora.github.io/nft-components?path=/story/renderer-mediaconfiguration--page)
  - Configure the text, theme, and network settings for the zNFT.
- [AuctionHouseList](https://ourzora.github.io/nft-components?path=/docs/renderer-auctionhouselist--images)
  - Load a list of auctions for a given curator

### Key Features:

- [Server-side rendering](https://ourzora.github.io/nft-components?path=/story/about-serverrendering--page)
- [Customizable theming / styling](https://ourzora.github.io/nft-components?path=/story/theming-previewcomponent--preview-card)
- [Customizable information ordering / display](https://ourzora.github.io/nft-components?path=/story/renderer-about--page)
- [Updatable media rendering](https://ourzora.github.io/nft-components?path=/story/about-customcomponentdocs--page)

### Quickstart

1. Install package:
```bash
yarn add @zoralabs/nft-components
```

2. Render a NFT Thumbnail:

```tsx
import { NFTPreview } from "@zoralabs/nft-components";

export const Page = () => <NFTPreview id="3002" />;
```

3. Render a NFT Full page:

```tsx
import { NFTFullPage } from "@zoralabs/nft-components";

export const Page = () => <NFTFullPage id="3002" />;
```

4. Render a list of auctions for a curator:

```tsx
import { NFTFullPage } from "@zoralabs/nft-components";

export const Page = ({curatorId}: {curatorId: string}) => (
    <AuctionHouseList
      onClick={(_, auction) => alert(`Clicked token ${auction.tokenId}`)}
      curatorIds={[curatorId]}
    />
);
```


4. Render a proposed auction:

```tsx
import { NFTProposal } from "@zoralabs/nft-components";

export const Page = () => <NFTProposal id="3002" />;
```
